Pure binary loader.

* it's loaded at 0x08810000
* it's max 64 kB
* it's pure binary MIPS code
* you have to use syscalls and not NIDs
* it runs in user space!
* it's called h.bin (Hello world) in the root of the MemoryStick


Set the frame_buffer.png as background like before and Place the new overflow.tif in the photos dir and the h.bin on the memory stick. It loads ms0:/h.bin
